## Introduction

Repository for the codes used for the analyses of Aaltonen, Tervola & Heino (2021) Analysing the effects of healthcare payment policies in conjunction with tax-benefit policies: A microsimulation study with real-world  healthcare data. Analyses in the article were conducted using SAS.

The study was conducted using national tax-benefit microsimulation model, SISU, and its nationally representative 15% sample of households in Finland in 2017 (n=826,001) linked with administrative real-world healthcaredata (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare Care Register for Health Care, HILMO; and Social Insurance Institution of Finland, Kela, National Health Insurance reimbursement registers).
